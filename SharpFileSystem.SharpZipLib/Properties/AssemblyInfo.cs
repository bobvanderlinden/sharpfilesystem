// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]

// This is substituted as $version$ in the .nuspec. It lets you use free-form text,
// meaning you can put semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) (3 parts rather than 4) in there.
// This is also helpful because it shows up as “Product version” in Windows Explorer’s
// Properties window.
